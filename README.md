# 📘 Python Samples Repository

This repository contains **10 progressively larger Python examples**, designed to demonstrate coding patterns, scalability, and complexity growth across different project sizes.  
Each file builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts, structures, and problem‑solving approaches.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File Name                  | Approx. LOC | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `Example-01 (~120 lines).py`  | 120   | Introductory sample — basic Python syntax, functions, and control flow. |
| `Example-02 (~180 lines).py`  | 180   | Adds modularization, reusable functions, and simple data structures. |
| `Example-03 (~250 lines).py`  | 250   | Demonstrates object‑oriented programming with classes and methods. |
| `Example-04 (~400 lines).py`  | 400   | Introduces error handling, file I/O, and structured logging. |
| `Example-05 (~600 lines).py`  | 600   | Expands into multi‑module organization and intermediate algorithms. |
| `Example-06 (~800 lines).py`  | 800   | Covers advanced data structures, decorators, and comprehensions. |
| `Example-07 (~1000 lines).py` | 1000  | Implements a small CLI tool with argument parsing and modular design. |
| `Example-08 (~1500 lines).py` | 1500  | Adds persistence (SQLite/JSON), configuration management, and testing. |
| `Example-09 (~2200 lines).py` | 2200  | Demonstrates larger‑scale architecture with multiple layers and utilities. |
| `Example-10 (~3000 lines).py` | 3000  | Full mini‑project: combines OOP, error handling, persistence, and CLI into a cohesive application. |

## 🎯 Purpose

- Show how **Python projects scale** from small scripts to multi‑file applications.  
- Provide **learning material** for developers who want to see growth in codebase size and complexity.  
- Serve as a **reference** for structuring Python projects at different stages.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Al-Taie/PythonSamples.git
cd PythonSamples
```

Run any example:
```bash
python3 "Example-04 (~400 lines).py"
```

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- Standard library only (no external dependencies unless noted in comments)

---

## 📖 Suggested Learning Path

1. Start with **Example‑01** to understand the basics.  
2. Progress sequentially — each file introduces new concepts.  
3. By **Example‑10**, you’ll see how a real‑world mini‑project is structured.

## 🤝 Contribution

This repo is meant as a **learning showcase**. Feel free to fork, experiment, and adapt the samples for your own projects.
